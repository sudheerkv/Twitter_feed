@kellabyte @arnonrgo on the contrary, see http://t.co/C2fcOH4UAz. @josephxsxn did it *without* any help from YARN seasoned devs. So YMMV.
@kellabyte @arnonrgo with all due respect @edwardcapriolo spent all of a day or two to try something new, with some prejudice against it.
@kellabyte @arnonrgo also both mesos &amp; YARN are frameworks to write frameworks. Thus the complexity.
@kellabyte @arnonrgo I urge you to try yourselves and see before concluding based on others remarks. We are trying to reduce API verbosity.
@edwardcapriolo some of the verbosity is java (see https://t.co/VVzDUO4uB6 for comparison). And some of it is features - conf, failures etc.
